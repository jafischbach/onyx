CH1_SNOWGLOBE
Okay, so some of these make sense. A cabin in a snowy forest. A castle upon a snowy hill. Not that you have any interest in buying one, but at least they depict idylic scenes of wintry serenity. The others, on the other hand? Romanicus Station floating in a snowy void? The moon Rubicon Beta hovering in a winter wonderland? The entire planet Rubicon caught in a snowstorm? Those are just rediculous.

CH1_CUCKOO_CLOCK
A little animatronic figure pops out of each clock and screams "Cuckoo!" in a dozen languages at the top of each hour. A clock that goes nuts each hour whether you want it to or not? Who the hell thought that was a good idea? What moron would actually spend money on one? Not you, that's for sure!

CH1_GLASS_FIGURINES
Just a bunch of figurines made out of glass. Some are people, some are animals. You spot a startship or two and a few lighthouses. Most are small enough to sit in your palm, but a few are quite large. All are easily shattered, you assume. Total waste of money (and luggage space).
